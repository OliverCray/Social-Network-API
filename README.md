A user can perform the following CRUD operations on users:

- GET all users
- GET a single user by its \_id and populated thought and friend data
- POST a new user
- PUT to update a user by its \_id
- DELETE to remove user by its \_id

A user can perform the following CRUD operations on thoughts:

- GET all thoughts
- GET a single thought by its \_id
- POST a new thought
- PUT to update a thought by its \_id
- DELETE to remove a thought by its \_id

A user can perform the following CRUD operations on reactions to thoughts:

- POST to add a reaction to a thought
- DELETE to remove a reaction by the reaction's reactionId value

A user can perform the following CRUD operations on a friend list:

- POST to add a new friend to a user's friend list
- DELETE to remove a friend from a user's friend list

If you wish to seed the database with some data, type the following command in the terminal.

```sh
npm run seed
```

To start the server, type the following command in the terminal.

```

To run the server in development mode, using nodemon, type the following command in the terminal. This will automatically restart the server when changes are made to the code.

```sh
npm run dev
```

To test the routes, use a tool like Postman or Insomnia. The routes are as follows:
